 Hello and welcome to using openFileManager.
 This program is my goal at creating a entirely free and open source file browser for the Android
 powered devices. It currently only officially supports MDPI and HDPI as that is what screen i have
 tested it on. Any additions are appreciated and will be released under the license that is affixed
 to the software as a whole.



 Areas that are currently undergoing main development:

 Core features
    --(Multiple)Item select
    Open as
    --Rename
    --Cut/Paste
    --Delete file/folder
    --New file/folder
    Add/remove favorites(Currently working on)
    Set home directory(Needs a preference to set/read from)
    Forward/Back directory switching(Needs the logic)

 The application consists of two activities. The main file manager activity and the settings menu.
 Since the main view takes an adapter, the adapter just needs have its data changed and refreshed
 to update the list type view. This is done by having each item send a broadcast that the app
 catches and in turn refreshes the adapter with the appropriate data.

 Each major view group consists of a fragment, the main list view, the side view, the cut/paste view
 and possibly others in the future. Each fragment has a series of callbacks(listeners) that is used
 to communicate with the fragment in a defined manner. All fragments are managed in the main
 activity and is used as the communication and callback medium.
